## Testing

### Test Results


Please note these results are a .xlsx file and will require excel, google docs or compatiable program to open the file.<br>
All Pages were run through the [W3C HTML Validator]and showed no errors.<br>
CSS Stylesheet was run through the [W3C CSS Validator] and showed no errors.<br>

Test 01 - Test responsiveness of website on various screen sizes on Firefox. Website's responsive, no images are distorted and all elements are within the correct sizes. <br>

Test 04 - Test the relevante links (such as download CV and contact me links) on 3 different browsers  (Chrome, Safari & Firefox) - All clickable links work and produce the allocated outcome. <br>
Test 05 - Hover elemnt changes color on hover - On hover the appropriate element will change colour. <br>
Test 06 - Website implementation vs Actual implementation - Although the original goal was to have all pages as their own page the flow was better on a 1 paged different section website. <br>



### Issues and Resolutions to issues found during testing
Issue 1 - Navigation menu wouldn't shrink to smaller screens - Using bootstrap to create 1 nav menu instead of 2 different ones for screensizes made it easy so solve this issue.<br>
Issue 2 - Pop up wouldn't scale with screen size - Gave it a variable sizes rather than fixed to allow for scaling. <br>
Issue 3 - Clicking on portflio button was not going to correct place on page - fixed by assigning it a location to go to. <br>
Issue 4 - Download link no working - fixed for somereason was not allowing the download.<br>

### Issues with no known Resolutions
I have found that my website has a hotizontal scroll, of about 5mm wide, going through multiple fourms and through various channels of people no known fix for this is apparent.
There is no hidden variables that are makeing the horizonal scroll.
When looking through the website please be mindful of this.
