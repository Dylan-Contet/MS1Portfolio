## Testing

### Test Results


Please note these results are a .xlsx file and will require excel, google docs or compatiable program to open the file.<br>
All Pages were run through the [W3C HTML Validator]and showed no errors.<br>
CSS Stylesheet was run through the [W3C CSS Validator] and showed no errors.<br>

Test 01 - Test responsiveness of website on various screen sizes on Firefox. Website's responsive, no images are distorted and all elements are within the correct sizes 
Test 02 - Test responsiveness of website on various screen sizes on Safari.  Website's responsive, no images are distorted and all elements are within the correct sizes 
Test 03 - Test responsiveness of website on various screen sizes on Chrome.  Website's responsive, no images are distorted and all elements are within the correct sizes 
Test 04 - Test the relevante links (such as download CV and contact me links) on 3 different browsers  (Chrome, Safari & Firefox) - All clickable links work and produce the allocated outcome.
Test 05 - Hover elemnt changes color on hover - On hover the appropriate element will change colour
Test 06 - Website implementation vs Actual implementation - Although the original goal was to have all pages as their own page the flow was better on a 1 paged different section website.



### Issues and Resolutions to issues found during testing
Issue 1 - Navigation menu wouldn't shrink to smaller screens - Using bootstrap to create 1 nav menu instead of 2 different ones for screensizes made it easy so solve this issue.
Issue 2 - Pop up wouldn't scale with screen size - Gave it a variable sizes rather than fixed to allow for scaling 
Issue 3 - Clicking on portflio button was not going to correct place on page - fixed by assigning it a location to go to 
Issue 4 - Download link no working - fixed for somereason was not allowing the download.
